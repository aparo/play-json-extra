play-json-extra
===============

I love working in Scala and ScalaJS. This library is my **opinionated** wrapper of several libraries merged to 
efficiently working in JSON word. 

Main Features are:

* Play JSON for ScalaJS 
* **JsonFormat** macro annotation for lazy people
* Default field values populated in missing JSON field
* Field rewrite for Play JSON ("key") 
* +22 field case class formatter and more [Play Json Extension](http://play-json-extra.megl.io/playjsonext.html)
* **Joda Datetime** for Scala and ScalaJS
* [Strong Typed Enum](http://play-json-extra.megl.io/macrame.html) (String and Int) for Scala and ScalaJS
* [Variant Types](http://play-json-extra.megl.io/variants.html)
